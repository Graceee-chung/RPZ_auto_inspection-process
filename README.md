# RPZ_auto_inspection-process
This project automates processing government RPZ (Response Policy Zone) case folders by extracting domains from files, validating formats and top-level domains, checking against whitelists, and generating standardized csv outputs. Then, archives results, zips documents, and integrates with Outlook for automatic email reporting.
